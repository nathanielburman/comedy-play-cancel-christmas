Cancel Christmas - The Show
A theatrical, musical screenplay of the works of Nathaniel Burman in Honor Citizen.

Version 1

tells a story about three tales: a child who believes and finds truth, a mother who provides for herself, and a man who plays santa.

The play starts out with the unmistakingly Christmas morning in one family's life.  And then it progresses by explaining how this one moment came to be by telling the story of others that conspired to make it happen.  It tells how one child’s Christmas will never be the same. And, a new Santa is born.  Should we continue this tradition?  Is Christmas too big to fail? or is Christmas too big to quit?

When text is displayed in italics it means that part takes place during the song play.

Current Track List:
Voidmas (Christmas Void)  |  Part-Time Man  |  Christ-ions  |  I Wanna Be Santa  |
Epic Beard Santa Man  |  Live a Lie  |  Santa Claus Isn’t Real  |  Santa Is Your Momma |
Gimme Some Presents  |  Christmas Everyday
